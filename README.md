<h2>Summer Internship - II</h2>
# Web Ddevelopment Summer Internship 2024 - Project Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Web Development Summer Internship 2024! This project showcases the work done during the internship, including practical insights and hands-on experience with Prodigy Infotech. 

# Start of Internship

## 1️⃣ Week 1

**Day 1:**
- Researched best practices for creating responsive landing pages, including layout design and user experience.
- Initialized a new Git repository for version control of the landing page project.
- Created the basic HTML structure for the landing page, including the header and main content sections.

**Day 2:**
- Applied CSS styles to the HTML structure to define the overall look and feel of the page.
- Implemented responsive design techniques using CSS media queries to ensure the landing page looks good on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktop monitors.

**Day 3:**
- Added animations and transitions using CSS and JavaScript to improve the user experience.
- Ensured that images and media are optimized for fast loading times without compromising quality.

**Day 4:**
- Implemented smooth transitions for header navigation links (Home, About, Contact Us) using JavaScript.
- Added an interactive feature where the watch image moves in the direction of the cursor.

**Day 5:**
- Documented the code and pushed it on GitHub.
- Deployed the landing page to a live server and tested it in a real-world environment to ensure it works as intended.

**Plans for next week:**
- Next week, the focus will shift to creating a Stopwatch web application that allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer.

**Summary:**
This week, I focused on developing a responsive landing page. I researched best practices, initialized a Git repository, built the HTML structure, applied CSS styles, and implemented JavaScript features for an improved user experience. The project was documented and deployed successfully.


## 2️⃣ Week 2

**Day 1:**
- Researched best practices for creating a Stopwatch web application, including layout design and user experience.
- Initialized a new Git repository for version control of the Stopwatch web application project.
- Planned the main functionalities: start, stop, reset buttons, and a lap display of milliseconds, seconds, and minutes elapsed. Created a basic project structure with folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets.

**Day 2:**
- Started building the structure of the UI using HTML. Used `div` elements to create the overall layout and `span` elements for displaying the time components. Created `button` elements for the Start, Stop, Reset, and Lap functions.

**Day 3:**
- Styled the UI with CSS, ensuring that the buttons are distinct and easily clickable, and that the time display is large and clear.
- Implemented logic to handle button presses. First, implemented Start Button in JavaScript.

**Day 4:**
- Implemented logic for the Stop Button and Reset Button in JavaScript.
- For the Stop button, wrote JavaScript logic to clear the interval timer that was initiated during the Start operation. This action effectively paused the stopwatch. The Reset button functionality was implemented to reset all time-tracking variables (milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours) back to zero.

**Day 5:**
- Added Lap button functionality to display lap times below the stopwatch.
- Documented the code and pushed it on GitHub.
- Tested the app thoroughly (starting, stopping, resetting, edge cases).

**Plans for next week:**
- Next week, the focus will shift to creating a Tic-Tac-Toe web application and a Personal Portfolio Website.

**Summary:**
This week, I developed a Stopwatch web application. The project involved researching best practices, planning functionalities, and implementing them using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application was tested thoroughly and documented on GitHub.


## 3️⃣ Week 3

**Day 1:**
- Researched best practices for creating a Tic-Tac-Toe web application, focusing on layout design and user experience.
- Initialized a new Git repository for version control of the Tic-Tac-Toe web application project.
- Planned the main functionalities: a 3x3 grid for the game board, player turn indicator, and game status display (win, lose, draw). Created a basic project structure with folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets.

**Day 2:**
- Started building the structure of the UI using HTML. Used `div` elements to create the game board with nine cells. Created a `div` for displaying the current player's turn and game status. Added Button elements for restarting the game.

**Day 3:**
- Styled the UI with CSS, ensuring the game board and cells are visually distinct and clickable. Made sure the player turn indicator and game status display are clearly visible.
- Started implementing basic JavaScript to handle cell clicks and update the UI accordingly. Added functionality to alternate turns between players (X and O).

**Day 4:**
- Implemented logic to determine when a player wins or when the game ends in a draw.
- Wrote JavaScript functions to check for winning combinations after each move. Updated the game status display to reflect the current game state like win, draw, loss. Added JavaScript logic for the restart button to reset the game.

**Day 5:**
- Added feedback for winning combinations like highlighting the winning line and stopping the game.
- Documented the code and pushed it on GitHub.
- Tested the app thoroughly to make sure everything works correctly.

**Plans for next week:**
- Next week, the focus will shift to creating a Weather web application that lets users view current weather conditions, search for different locations, and refresh the weather data using an API.

**Summary:**
Created a Tic-Tac-Toe web application. Built the game board, implemented game logic for alternating turns and determining game outcomes, and styled the UI. Added feedback for winning combinations and ensured the game resets correctly.

## 4️⃣ Week 4

**Day 1:**
- Researched best practices for creating a Weather web application, including layout design, user experience, and popular weather APIs from the OpenWeatherMap website.
- Initialized a new Git repository for version control of the Weather web application project.

**Day 2:**
- Started building the structure of the UI using HTML. Used `div` elements to create the overall layout, and `span` elements for displaying the weather components (e.g., temperature, humidity, weather description). Created an input for city search and a search button to search a city's temperature.

**Day 3:**
- Styled the UI with CSS, ensuring that the search input and buttons are distinct and easily clickable, and that the weather display elements (temperature, humidity, description) are large and clear.
- Implemented logic to handle button presses. First, implemented the search functionality in JavaScript to fetch weather data from the API.

**Day 4:**
- For fetching weather data, wrote JavaScript logic to call the weather API with the user-specified city names.
- Implemented error handling for scenarios like invalid city names.
- Created functions to handle the API response and update the DOM with the fetched weather data.

**Day 5:**
- Added features such as displaying images representing the weather condition, showing wind speed, and other relevant weather data.
- Documented the code and pushed it on GitHub.
- Tested the app thoroughly to make sure everything works correctly.

**Summary:**
Developed a Weather web application. Built the UI, integrated a weather API to fetch and display weather data, and added features such as search functionality and weather condition images. Implemented error handling and tested the application.
